-= Twilio SMS Example =-

This is a simple Sinatra app that lets you learn the basics of 
creating a SMS application using Twilio.

To Run: Go to TwilioSMS folder => type "ruby index.rb" in terminal => http://localhost:4567

After you push this to a public URL, add it to your dashboard. Make sure to specify the correct HTTP method (get or post) that your application responds to.
